    | API, giving you convenient access to each back-end using the same
    | syntax for each one. Here you may set the default queue driver.

    | Note that the async driver provided by Barry vd. Heuvel's Async Queue
    | Driver package (https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-async-queue).
    |
    | Supported: "sync", "async", "beanstalkd", "sqs", "iron", "redis"
